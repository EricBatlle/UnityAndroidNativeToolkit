# UnityAndroidNativeToolkit üß∞
*Created by Eric Batlle Clavero*
 
This **Android App** made with **Unity** includes a complete **AndroidToolkit plugin** to allow Unity to **use native Android OS** features such as taking shots with the camera, pop dialogs, pick contacts, etc..

This repository is divided in 2 parts:

- Unity Project (**C#**)
- Android Plugin (**Java**)

## How to Use ‚öôÔ∏è

If you want to test the app, you can download the APK from [here](https://github.com/EricBatlle/UnityAndroidNativeToolkit/releases/download/v1.0/UnityNativeToolkit_1.0.apk).

If you want to open the project and check the code, you need to have **Unity** and **AndroidStudio** installed and updated.

If you want to scratch the code:

- To check **Unity** project, **open the project**, select **NativeToolkit** scene.
Either inside the unity project or simply dragging the **.cs** classes on your editor, you have to watch on to the classes located on ``UnityAndroidNativeToolkit/Assets/Scripts``. 
- To check **Android Plugin** you can do it opening the solution with **AndroidStudio** and checking the classes located in ``UnityNativeToolkitPlugin_Android\NativeToolkit\src\main\java\com\eric\nativetoolkit``.

App Functionality is simple, just press the feature button you want to test. Some features like Dialogs also have toggles to specify some parameters.


On code side, the only thing to keep in mind is to make a Script (like ``NativeToolkit.cs`` in the example) that have a reference to ``NativeToolkitPlugin`` and initialize the plugin doing: ``pluginReferenceVariable = NativeToolkitPlugin.GetPlatformPluginVersion(this.gameObject.name);``

From here you can call all plugin features simply calling ``pluginReferenceVariable.`` and the feature you want, like ``pluginReferenceVariable.TakeShot()``.

If you don't want to implement all features callbacks, remember to only implement the desired feature interface, like ``INativeCamera``, instead of ``INativeToolkitPlugin``. This last one implements all features interfaces.

## Multiple plugins support üîå

This plugin has been made following a **fragment-pattern** to avoid errors that can be derived from extending *UnityPlayerActivity*.

This way you can integrate this plugin with your projects even if they already have more plugins. **Truly pluggable**.

If you already have imported on your project the library ``core-1.3.1.aar`` or similar, remember to remove it, or remove the plugin one.

## Upgrading dependencies üìú

Keep in mind that the actual release ([v1.0](https://github.com/EricBatlle/UnityAndroidNativeToolkit/releases/download/v1.0/UnityNativeToolkit_1.0.apk)) of the plugin works with **AndroidX** dependencies. That means that is targeting **Android 9** (API level 28).
